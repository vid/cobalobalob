const xoverallTask = `A new Open Source web site to connect public servants, experts, and members of the public. They can connect to each other, and discuss topics. 
Although the system is implemented using abstracted vendor tech, strictly avoiding proprietary components. It must outline where any proprietary elements are included , and why.
A key feature is the site uses the graph database to indicate relationships between people and discussions, and also to organize information so it can be subscribed to at different levels.
The site uses open, portable Linked Data, which emphasises re-usability, portability and provenance, so people can use it in their own databases, or use it with their own algorithms.
The site will be designed with as few as possible unique features, and instead will use existing, well known, open source components, and integrate them using Linked Data. 
Rather than creating many different types of interactions, the same pattern of data and interactions will be used for all features, so that the site is easy to use and understand.
Every aspect of the application must be graphable using consistent Haibun identifiers, so that the concept, data, service, interfaces and elements, browser, user and government planes can be viewed together or by perspective.
The application can also query other information sources using Linked Data, and integrate the results.
Describe specific AI features that be integrated into the site to benefit end users, like sentiment analysis, summarization and topic maps, and a mechanism for users to moderate the results alongside other content.
The AI features will especially help to cluster content, but a beautiful and accessible visual interface will make it easy to dive into clustered content and reorganize it according to different perspectives.

Subscriptions are an extremely important part of the site. They can be very finely or coarsely created and shared or "forked."
Users can be notified of subscription changes using a variety of methods, and can subscribe to other users' subscriptions, and since every content type can be built on, form conversation groups around them.

All Typescript libraries for the application will be designed for re-use throughout the application, and in end user applications that can run standalone in browsers.

All help is integrated into the application at the component level using Haibun identifiers, with AI and discussion support at the component level. There is no need for a help page or manual.

All data, whether queried, human entered, or AI supplied, must be referenced by a known site, must be assigned provenance and a Haibun identifier, and graphable.
Features like upvoting and downvoting are not used, instead users must provide sentiment comments such as "support," "disagree," and these tags must include citations and user comments. 
The sentiment tags can also be commented on.
Use OpenID Connect, Decentralized Identifiers and Fediverse protocols for authorization. The site itself has no "create account" feature.
After logging in and when using Decentralized Identifiers, the site can also be used pseudonymously, including creating data. 
A moderation scheme allows any user to evaluate content, and users can adopt combinations of other user moderations.
The site must initially support hundreds of thousands of users, with tens of thousands of simult√¶neous requests.
This site will replace an existing site based on forum software. Highlight in all relevant writeups how the new site will provide contemporary, user friendly features suitable for a government-citizen portal.
All elements of the site can be developed using the outlined process, with users chosing their own transparent moderation scheme.
Include in relevant sections how the application can scale to millions of users.
For all content, use formal Government language, but avoid confusing phrases or words.
